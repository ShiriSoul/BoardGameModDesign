# Prototype Concept For Risk Board Game
This is to show a concept where the board game's map has a LED display for each territory.
An app will allow you to switch the territory's color to the current controlling team's color.
There is also triangle buttons to adjust the troop count for that territory, which is displayed on the board.
This repository is just to show off the concept of a working app. In concept the app will allow you to scan territories to make changes to the scanned territory.

Progress:
Pt 1: Rough draft was a quick paper sketch having the board game and a small electronic to display troop count and adjusted with buttons on the electronic.
Pt 2: Revision to electronic built into board and the territories change color based on controlling team color.
Pt 3: Concept Prototype for an app to change territory color and display troop count, which the electronics are built into the board with LED or digital displays.
